# Words Annotate
[English](README.md) [简体中文](README-zh.md)

Words Annotate is a plugin designed to help users label the meaning of words they are not familiar with. It provides a convenient way to annotate and store definitions for unknown words.

## Features

### Input meaning

![Annotate word](/gifs/Annotate_word.gif)

To label the meaning of a word, first select the word you want to annotate, and then use the command "Annotate word".

### Get meaning

![Find word](/gifs/Find_word.gif)

To retrieve the meaning of a word, use the command "Find word".

## Code Block

You can use the `words` code block to query related words. For example, you can use `All-Meaning` to list all annotated words and their meanings.

## Future Improvements

1. Optimize the annotation interface to support Chinese.
2. Improve the data storage method.
3. Implement real-time lookup (display the meaning of a word when hovering for a certain period of time).
4. Assess user familiarity with words after a certain period of time.
5. Integrate translation API to enhance the speed of user annotation.
